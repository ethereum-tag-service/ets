# Reusable workflow for code verification, triggered by pull requests or manually
#
# Jobs sequence:
# 1. Lint: Code style and quality checks
#    - Restores cached workspace
#    - Runs repository and code linting
# 2. Build: Package compilation and validation
#    - Builds all packages
#    - Validates package exports
#    - Checks for unused dependencies
# 3. Test: Triggers solidity-screener.yml for smart contract validation
#
# Note: Each job requires proper PNPM setup to access the package manager
