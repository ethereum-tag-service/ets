****

ETS is a crypto-incentivized, decentralized tagging service that enables third-party services (dApps, platforms, applications, smart contracts) and/or their customers to tag any addressable online artifact (nft, URL, transaction record) and record it to the blockchain.

The service employs a novel, patent-pending invention whereby the tags themselves are ERC-721 non-fungible tokens that can be re-used for subsequent tagging by any participant of the system. Once recorded, the service indexes the tagging data and exposes it via public APIs.

For projects that are actively tagging or considering tagging content, our solution will replace centralized infrastructure; simplify & automate tagging; increase customer engagement; and generate additional revenue streams.
