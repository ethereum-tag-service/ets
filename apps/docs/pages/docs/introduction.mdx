# Welcome to ETS

We're glad you're here!

This site provides documentation for ETS, a community-owed content tagging
protocol for the decentralized internet. Here you'll find both high-level and
technical information for developers, end-users and anyone else trying to
understand how to benefit from this new technology.

**Essentials** provides a high-level overview of ETS.

**Develop** details developers can understand, improve and contribute back to the
ETS.

**Implement** shows how to get ETS up and running on your platform.

_**One preface before you press on**_...like the protocol itself, this
documentation is in a very early state. Many sections are simply placeholders.
We hope this will change as we welcome developers like you to join the ETS
community and contribute to this site and to the project.

## What is ETS?

ETS is a simple, decentralized protocol built for developers to tokenize
hashtag strings as non-fungible tokens (NFTs), link them with online media and
surface this data for use in networks, platforms and applications.

Stitched into this functionality are crypto-economic incentive mechanisms that
harness the self-interest of participants to drive positive network growth.
