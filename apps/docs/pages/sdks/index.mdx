# SDKs Introduction

The `sdk-core` package is a vanilla TypeScript library designed to facilitate interaction with the Ethereum Tag Service (ETS) smart contracts. It aims to facilitate the creation, management, and querying ETS tagging records on the Ethereum blockchain. The SDK abstracts the complexity of direct contract interactions, offering a more developer-friendly way to integrate ETS functionalities into applications.

The `sdk-react-hooks` package is a library of React hooks that encapsulate the logic and interactions of the `sdk-core` for use within React applications. These hooks abstract the complexity of blockchain interactions, allowing developers to easily integrate the functionalities of the Ethereum Tag Service (ETS) into their React applications.
