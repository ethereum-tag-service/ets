# Tokenomics

Ethereum Tag Service (ETS) employs a tokenomics system to incentivize participation and reward contributors across its decentralized tagging system. By integrating tagging fees and auctions into its revenue model, ETS ensures value flows to all stakeholders, promoting sustainability and growth.

## Incentives & Revenue Sharing

### Revenue Sources
The primary revenue streams in ETS are:

1. **Tagging Fees:**
   - A per-tag fee is charged when creating tagging records.
   - This fee incentivizes participants and supports ecosystem operations.

2. **CTAG Auctions:**
   - Tags (CTAGs) are auctioned to the highest bidder.
   - Auctions incentivize early adopters and ensure fair distribution of tags.

### Revenue Distribution Table

| Revenue Source    | Relayer | Creator | Owner | Platform |
|-------------------|---------|---------|-------|----------|
| **Tagging Fees**| 30%     | --      | 50%   | 20%      |
| **CTAG Auction**  | 20%     | 40%     | --    | 40%      |
| **CTAG Resale**   | --      | --      | 100%  | --       |

Note: The revenue distribution percentages outlined above are preliminary and experimental, subject to change based on further analysis and ecosystem feedback.


### Key Points:
- **CTAGs**:
  - Upon creation, ownership of a CTAG is initially held by the ETS platform until released for auction.
  - Until a CTAG is purchased at auction, the owner's share of tagging record fees flows to the CTAG creator.

- **Relayers:**
  - Relayers earn a portion of tagging fees whenever CTAGs they originated are used in future tagging records, regardless of which relayer creates the record.
  - Receive a share of auction proceeds when CTAGs they originate are sold.

- **Creators:**
  - Taggers who introduce new, unique CTAGs during the creation of tagging records are credited as the Creator.
  - Until a CTAG is purchased at auction, the owner's share of tagging record fees flows to the CTAG creator.
  - Gain attribution and a share of tagging fees until their CTAG is sold.

- **Owners:**
  - Receive tagging fees tied to their purchased CTAGs, turning them into revenue-generating assets.

- **Platform:**
  - Captures a portion of revenue to support development and protocol maintenance.

## Sustainability and Growth

ETS tokenomics prioritize:
- **Aligned Incentives:** Ensuring every participant’s success contributes to the ecosystem’s growth.
- **Decentralized Value Capture:** Revenue is distributed fairly among contributors.
- **Scalability:** A flexible system that adapts to new use cases and innovations.

Through these mechanisms, ETS establishes a thriving ecosystem where tags become valuable, composable assets, and participants are empowered to innovate.
