## Understanding ETS

ETS is a full stack protocol with a suite of tools and services that allow you to create, manage, and query tagging records and CTAGs on an EVM blockchain.

## dApp Developers
If you have a dApp and want to quickly integrate ETS into your dApp, you'll want to use the [ETS SDK-CORE](https://github.com/ethereum-tag-service/ets-sdk) or the SDK-REACT-HOOKS, to read and write to/from the ETS smart contracts. In addition, you can use the [ETS GraphQL API](https://github.com/ethereum-tag-service/ets-graphql-api) to query the ETS tagging graph from a varitety of facets.

## Protocol Development
If you are a developer or reasearcher interested in contrituting the ETS protocol, you'll want to head to the Protocol Development section of the documentation. In there you'll find information on developing the protocol including:

- Local development environment setup which includes smart contract deployment, local GraphQL node and ETS Explorer deployment.
- How to deploy the ETS smart contracts
- How to interact with the ETS smart contracts using our suite of Hardhat tasks
