# SDKs Introduction

The `sdk-core` package is a vanilla TypeScript library designed to facilitate interaction with the Ethereum Tag Service (ETS) smart contracts. It aims to facilitate the creation, management, and querying ETS tagging records on the Ethereum blockchain. The SDK abstracts the complexity of direct contract interactions, offering a more developer-friendly way to integrate ETS functionalities into applications.
