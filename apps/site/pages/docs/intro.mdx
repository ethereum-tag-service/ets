# Why ETS? [A brief introduction to ETS]

Every second, 4,000 to 6,000 tags are applied on the web, with Twitter alone supporting over 125 million tags daily. Tags form the backbone of online content discovery, yet this activity runs on fragmented, siloed infrastructures that waste developer resources and stifle interoperability. Amid this massive scale and inefficiency, we see tagging as more than just a metadata problem—it’s also an economic one.

We view tagging in economic terms:

**Tagging = Work:** Humans and machines invest effort and resources into creating, managing, and curating tags.

**Tags = Digital Real Estate:** Like domain names, tags are unique namespaces linking to content. But unlike domain names, tags can connect a single namespace to countless targets—and multiple tags can point to the same resource.

In web2, there’s no concept of owning a tag namespace. This leaves tags at the mercy of centralized platforms that profit from this valuable graph without sharing the upside. We believe blockchain and crypto primitives can solve this by introducing ownership, incentives, and composability.

### How does ETS work?
ETS is an experimental, permissionless protocol that lets dApps, platforms, and smart contracts tag any online resource—NFTs, URLs, transaction records—and record these “tagging records” on-chain. The data is indexed and made available through public APIs, enabling easy discovery and integration.

When a new tag namespace appears, ETS immediately tokenizes it as an ERC-721 NFT, creating a “CTAG” (Composable Tag). Over time, these CTAGs can evolve into valuable digital real estate, connecting people, places, and things across Web3. Anyone can own, build upon, or remix these composable tags, encouraging innovation and collaboration.

### Crypto Economics
[Coming soon: We’ll explore incentive mechanisms, auctions for premium namespaces, and economic models that reward ecosystem participants.]

### Use Cases
ETS unlocks a wide range of use cases: decentralized social bookmarking for curating NFTs, historical snapshots, or tracking blockchain activity; tagging infrastructure for blogging platforms, social media, or analytics tools; and even a marketplace for tokenized tag namespaces (CTAGs), where tags become valuable, composable digital real estate.

### Next Steps
While ETS is still evolving, we’ve already made significant progress—our stack is up and running on the Arbitrum Sepolia and Base Sepolia testnets (with more on the horizon), complete with a proof-of-concept [playground](https://arbitrumsepolia.app.ets.xyz/playground) and [code examples](https://github.com/ethereum-tag-service/ets/tree/stage/examples) for interacting with the protocol.

Our roadmap includes deeper documentation, enhanced tooling, and incentive models aimed at driving broader adoption and fostering community involvement.

We invite developers to explore these existing deployments, experiment with the protocol, and help shape the future of decentralized tagging. Check out our documentation, try our APIs, and dive into our code repositories to begin integrating ETS into your own projects. And don't forget to join our community—we'd love your input, feedback, and collaboration as we continue to improve and expand ETS.
