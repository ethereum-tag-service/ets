# Why ETS? [A brief preamble on why we're building ETS]

## Frankly, we're not sure yet.

ETS is the consumate "solution without a problem" â€” borne from the observation that tags posess social and financial value, andIt's fair to say there's not thousands of people saying hey, I wish I could buy **#LebronJames** or **#CocaCola**.

## The Problems

Tags and tagging require work from both humans and machines. This work comes with a cost; someone or something does the tagging; someone pays for it; and someone earns from it. There's an hidden economy of tagging that's been around for years.



It's also fair to say that being namespaces that connect things, tags, like domain names, posess the qualities of digital real estate. Yet no market exists for this digital real estate.

If there's any fundimental goal of this project, turn tags into first class Web 3 primitives, reflecting the mantra that  It's to be a way for

We're not sure what real world problems we're solving yet. We just hope it becomes a useful tool for developers.

## The Solution

ETS is a protocol for tagging content on the Ethereum blockchain. It's a way to tokenize tags as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and link them with online media. It's a way to surface this data for use in networks, platforms and applications.

The protocol has the following key components:

1. **Smart contracts** that allow you to create, manage, and query tags and tagging records on an EVM blockchain.
2. A decentralized **subgraph API** on The Graph that allows you to query tagging records and their associated tags.
3. **Developer sdks** for vanilla javascript and React that leverage [Viem](https://viem.sh/) for interacting with ETS smart contracts.
4. A **tag auction** modeled after [Nouns DAO](https://nouns.wtf/) to ensure fair and limited tag distribution.
5. A **cryptoeconomic model** that rewards creators, owners and relayers for tagging records.
