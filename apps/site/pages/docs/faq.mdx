# FAQs [Frequently asked questions about ETS]

## What is ETS?
ETS, short for Ethereum Tag Service, is a decentralized protocol that reimagines tagging by combining the power of blockchain, ERC-721 NFTs, and open data standards. It captures the "**who**, **what**, **where**, **when**, and **why**" of tagging actions in a verifiable and interoperable way, enabling a new paradigm for digital content organization and monetization.

At the heart of ETS are its key objects—**Tags (CTAGs)**, **Targets**, and **Tagging Records**—that form the building blocks of the protocol. These interact with a set of actors, including **Relayers**, **Taggers**, **Creators**, and **Owners**, who participate in creating, propagating, and deriving value from tags and tagging. Together, these components power a decentralized ecosystem where attribution, ownership, and incentives align to foster collaboration and innovation.

## How does ETS work?
ETS operates on a system where:

- **Tags** are created as NFTs (CTAGs) on the blockchain, ensuring their uniqueness and ownership
- **Tagging Records** are created whenever a tag is applied to content, capturing the essential who, what, where, and when
- Applications integrate ETS through **Relayers** to enable tagging functionality for their users or other use cases

This creates a universal, interoperable tagging layer that can be used across any Web3 platform or application.

## Why is ETS needed?
Traditional tagging systems have several drawbacks:

- Centralization: Data is controlled by centralized entities, leading to potential censorship and gatekeeping.
- Redundancy: Individual platforms develop and maintain their own tagging systems, wasting resources.
- Fragmentation: Tags & tagging data are siloed within platforms, hindering cross-platform interaction and data analysis.

## What are the benefits of using ETS?
- Decentralization: ETS eliminates central control, promoting censorship resistance and wider access to tagging data.
- Cross-Platform Interoperability: Tags can be used and shared across different platforms, creating a more connected web3 ecosystem.
- New Revenue Streams: Tokenized tags can be owned and traded, opening new opportunities for developers and users.
- Improved Data Integrity: Blockchain technology ensures the transparency and immutability of tagging records.

## How is ETS different from ENS?
Both ETS and ENS use tokenized namespaces to connect data. However, ENS primarily focuses on one-to-one relationships between a name and a single address (like a website URL). In contrast, ETS supports many-to-many relationships, enabling a single tag to be associated with numerous pieces of content, making it suitable for versatile tagging applications.

## What is a CTAG?
A CTAG (Composable Tag) is an ERC-721 non-fungible token representing a specific tag within the ETS ecosystem. Each CTAG is unique and stores information about the tag string and its origin, including the creator and relayer involved in its creation.

## How are CTAGs created and distributed?
CTAGs are automatically created when a user applies a new tag to content through a relayer. Initially, newly minted CTAGs are held by ETS. The current plan involves releasing these CTAGs to the public through auctions, although a specific timeline is yet to be determined.

## What is the vision for the future of ETS?
The ultimate goal of ETS is to become a universal tagging system implemented by numerous applications across the internet. By providing a standardized and decentralized infrastructure for tagging, ETS aims to create a more open, transparent, and efficient web3 experience where data ownership and value are distributed among its participants.
