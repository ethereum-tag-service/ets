## What
A **Tagger** is any address (user or smart contract) that initiates tagging actions through an ETS Relayer. Taggers are the primary actors who associate CTAGs with content by creating and modifying Tagging Records.

## Why
Taggers enable ETS to:
- Build meaningful connections between content and tags
- Create value through content curation
- Drive protocol usage and tag adoption
- Generate tagging fees for CTAG owners
- Establish provenance of content associations

## How

Taggers interact with the protocol through authorized ETS Relayers, which handle tag creation, fee calculation, and record management.

### Actions Available to Taggers

1. **Apply Tags**
   - Add new tags to content via `applyTags()`
   - Create new tagging records
   - Append tags to existing records
   - Pay required tagging fees

2. **Replace Tags**
   - Overwrite existing tag sets via `replaceTags()`
   - Update entire tag collections
   - Pay fees only for new tags added

3. **Remove Tags**
   - Remove specific tags via `removeTags()`
   - Modify existing tagging records
   - No fees required for removal

### Tagging Fees

When applying or replacing tags, Taggers must pay fees that are:
- Calculated per CTAG used
- Based on protocol-governed rates
- Distributed to tag owners and relayers
- Only charged for new tags added

Removing tags from content is free to encourage content maintenance and accuracy.

### Record Ownership

- Taggers own the tagging records they create
- Only the original tagger can modify their records
- All tagging actions are permanently recorded on-chain
- Each record maintains clear attribution to its tagger

### Integration Patterns

Taggers typically interact with ETS through:
1. Application UIs built on RelayerClient
2. Direct smart contract integration with ETSRelayerV1
