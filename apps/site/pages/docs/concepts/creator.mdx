# Creator <Icon src="/icons/users.svg" size={36} alt="Creator Icon" /> [Tag namespace originators]

## What
A Creator is the address (user or contract) that first introduces a tag string to the ETS protocol through an authorized Relayer. Each CTAG permanently records its Creator, ensuring proper attribution and revenue distribution.

## Why
Creators enable ETS to:
- Expand the protocol's tag namespace
- Establish clear provenance of tag origination
- Drive organic tag ecosystem growth
- Distribute auction and fee revenue fairly
- Incentivize early protocol adoption

## How

Creators participate in the protocol through authorized ETS Relayers which handle tag validation and creation.

### 1. Tag Creation Process
- Submit tag string through Relayer
- Tag validated against protocol rules
- CTAG minted with Creator attribution
- Token initially held by platform
- Creator recorded in CTAG metadata

### 2. Revenue Streams

Creators earn revenue through two channels:

1. **Pre-Auction Tagging Fees**
   - Receive Owner's share (50%) of tagging fees
   - Fees collected until CTAG sold at auction
   - Distributed automatically per usage

2. **Auction Proceeds**
   - Receive 40% of final auction price
   - One-time payment upon auction settlement
   - Automatic distribution to Creator's address

### 3. Creator Attribution

```solidity
struct Tag {
    address relayer;      // Relayer facilitating creation
    address creator;      // Creator's permanent address
    string display;       // Original tag string
    bool premium;         // Premium flag (deprecated)
    bool reserved;        // Reserved flag (deprecated)
}
```

### 4. Revenue Distribution

| Revenue Source    | Creator Share | When Received |
|------------------|---------------|---------------|
| Tagging Fees     | 50%          | Pre-auction   |
| Auction Sale     | 40%          | Upon settlement|

### 5. Integration Patterns

Creators can submit tags through:

1. Application UIs using `RelayerClient`
2. Direct smart contract calls to `ETSRelayerV1`
