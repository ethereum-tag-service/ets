# CTAG <Icon src="/icons/tag.svg" size={36} alt="Tag Icon" /> [Building blocks of a universal tagging system]

## What
Short for "composable tag", it's unique ERC-721 NFT representing a tag namespace used within ETS.

## Why
CTAGs enable ETS to:
- Guarantee each tag string resolves to a single, definitive token
- Create permanent ownership rights for tag namespaces
- Build complete historical records of tag usage
- Drive value through protocol-wide fee distribution
- Enable consistent tag reuse across all applications
- Record immutable attribution for all tag actions

## How
CTAGs are deterministically generated from input tag strings through the [ETSToken contract](https://github.com/ethereum-tag-service/ets/blob/main/packages/contracts/contracts/ETSToken.sol).

<Callout type="tip">
All the CTAG details explained below can be visualized in real-time for any tag through the ETS Explorer. For example, check out [#unicorn](https://arbitrumsepolia.app.ets.xyz/explore/tags/unicorn)

### 1. Tag String Validation
The tokenization process begins with validating the input tag string to ensure it adheres to ETS standards. This includes:
- **Starting Character:** Must begin with `#`.
- **Allowed Characters:** Supports any [Unicode](https://home.unicode.org/) character.
- **Prohibited Characters:**
    - Spaces (0x20).
    - Additional `#` characters after the first position.
- **Length Requirements:** Must fall within `tagMinStringLength` and `tagMaxStringLength`.

| Input                | Valid/Invalid | Reason                                      | Namespace       |
|---------------------|---------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| `#example`         | ‚úÖ Valid      | Starts with `#`, no spaces, no extra `#`.   | `#example`          |
| `#Example123`      | ‚úÖ Valid      | Case-insensitive, alphanumeric allowed.     | `#example123`       |
| `#Á§∫‰æã`             | ‚úÖ Valid      | Contains valid Chinese characters.          | `#Á§∫‰æã`             |
| `#üöÄLaunch`         | ‚úÖ Valid      | Emoji and alphanumeric characters allowed.  | `#üöÄlaunch`         |
| `#üî•`               | ‚úÖ Valid      | Single emoji after `#` is valid.            | `#üî•`               |
| `#üí°GoodIdea`       | ‚úÖ Valid      | Emoji combined with alphanumeric is valid.  | `#üí°goodidea`       |
| `#Bad_Idea`       | ‚úÖ Valid      | Underscores are fine.                         | `#bad_idea`       |
| `#ŸÖÿ±ÿ≠ÿ®ÿß`           | ‚úÖ Valid      | Arabic script is valid.                     | `#ŸÖÿ±ÿ≠ÿ®ÿß`           |
| `#„Åì„Çì„Å´„Å°„ÅØ`        | ‚úÖ Valid      | Japanese Hiragana/Katakana are valid.       | `#„Åì„Çì„Å´„Å°„ÅØ`        |
| `#12345`           | ‚úÖ Valid      | Numeric-only tags after `#` are valid.      | `#12345`           |
| `example`          | ‚ùå Invalid    | Missing `#` at the start.                   | N/A                |
| `#example tag`     | ‚ùå Invalid    | Contains a space.                           | N/A                |
| `#example#tag`     | ‚ùå Invalid    | Contains an extra `#` after the first char. | N/A                |
| `#`                | ‚ùå Invalid    | Length is less than `tagMinStringLength`.   | N/A                |
| `#üî• üöÄ`            | ‚ùå Invalid    | Contains a space between emojis.            | N/A                |
| `#ÊµãËØï#tag`         | ‚ùå Invalid    | Contains an extra `#` after the first char. | N/A                |


### 2. CTAG Data Structure
```solidity
struct Tag {
    address relayer;   // Address of Relayer that facilitates CTAG creation
    address creator;   // Address that initiated CTAG creation
    string display;    // Display version of tag string
    bool premium;      // (deprecated)
    bool reserved;     // (deprecated)
}
```

### 3. ID Generation

CTAGs are identified by a unique ID computed from the lowercased tag string:

```solidity
tagId = uint256(keccak256(bytes(lowercased_tag)));
```

This means once `#Punks` is minted, all future inputs like `#PuNkS`, `#punks`, and `#PUNKS` will point to the CTAG with the namespace `#punks`. This ensures a single NFT for each unique tag namespace.

### 4. Creating CTAGs

All tag creation in ETS happens through [Relayers](/docs/concepts/relayer), which provide the interface between users and the protocol:

1. **Direct Tag Creation**
- Users submit tag strings via Relayer interface
- Relayer validates and forwards to ETS core
- Creator attribution recorded on-chain
- New CTAGs held by ETS platform
- Enters auction queue based on usage, with active tags released first

2. **Creation Through Tagging**
- Users submit tagging actions via Relayer
- ETS core checks if tag exists
- If tag is new, core automatically mints CTAG
- Tagger recorded as Creator
- New CTAG associated with [Target](/docs/concepts/target) in [Tagging Record](/docs/concepts/tagging-record)

<Callout type="info">
Relayers are the gateway for all protocol interactions, ensuring consistent validation, fee handling, and attribution tracking. Users cannot interact directly with ETS core contracts.
</Callout>

### 5. Purchasing CTAGs

CTAGs are distributed through a continuous English auction system (see [ETS Auction](/docs/concepts/auction)):

1. **Initial Holding**
   - Upon creation, CTAGs are held by ETS platform
   - Tags accumulate usage metrics while held
   - Most-used tags prioritized for auction release

2. **Auction Release**
   - Tags released through ETSAuctionHouse contract
   - Multiple concurrent auctions possible (default: 3)
   - 24-hour auction duration with anti-snipe buffer
   - Minimum bid increment of 5%
   - Reserve price in native currency (ETH/MATIC)

3. **Bidding Process**
   - First bid starts auction timer
   - Late bids extend auction by 15 minutes
   - Highest bidder wins ownership rights
   - Previous bidders automatically refunded

4. **Settlement & Transfer**
   - Any address can settle ended auctions
   - Winner receives CTAG ownership
   - Proceeds split between platform/creator/relayer
   - New ownership term begins

<Callout type="info">
The auction mechanism ensures fair market pricing while rewarding early tag creation and platform participation through revenue sharing.
</Callout>

### 6. Ownership and Term Length

Ownership terms are managed through the [ETSToken contract](https://github.com/ethereum-tag-service/ets/blob/main/packages/contracts/contracts/ETSToken.sol), creating a renewable ownership model that ensures active stewardship of CTAGs.

- Ownership term length is defined by `ownershipTermLength` protocol parameter
- Any address can renew a tag via `renewTag()`
- Term clock starts at transfer or last renewal timestamp
- Expired tags can be recycled by any address via `recycleTag()`
- Recycling transfers tag back to platform address
- Platform-held tags have no active term clock
- Term expiry checked via `tagOwnershipTermExpired()`
- Recycled tags become available for new auctions

### 7. Tag Reuse and Composability
Once a CTAG is minted, any future use of the same tag string when creating Tagging Records will reference the existing CTAG. This ensures:
  - Consistent tag reuse across the protocol.
  - Clear attribution and provenance of tag origination.
  - Audit trail for tagging actions.
  - Monetization through fees and auctions.

## **Tokenomics**

CTAGs generate revenue through two channels:

1. **Per-Tag Fee in Tagging Records**
   - ETS charges a micro-fee for each CTAG used in a [tagging record](/docs/concepts/tagging-record).
   - Fee distribution:
     - **Relayer**: For originating the CTAG.
     - **Owner**: As a return on their investment in the tag.
     - **Protocol**: To fund ongoing operations and development.

<Callout type="info">Until the tag has been purchased at auction, the Creator receives the Owner share of the tagging fee.</Callout>

2. **Auction Proceeds**
   - When a CTAG is sold at auction, proceeds are distributed among:
     - **Relayer**: For originating the CTAG.
     - **Creator**: For their initial contribution to the tag ecosystem.
     - **Protocol**: To support the protocol and incentivize adoption.

#### **Revenue Distribution Table**
The revenue distribution for fees and auction proceeds is governed by ETS-defined percentages.

| Revenue Source    | Relayer | Creator | Owner | Platform |
|-------------------|---------|---------|-------|----------|
| **Tagging Fees**| 30%     | --      | 50%   | 20%      |
| **CTAG Auction**  | 20%     | 40%     | --    | 40%      |
| **CTAG Resale**   | --      | --      | 100%  | --       |

*(Note: Percentages are preliminary and subject to change.)*
