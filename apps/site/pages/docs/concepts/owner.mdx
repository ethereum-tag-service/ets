# Owner <Icon src="/icons/users.svg" size={36} alt="Owner Icon" /> [CTAG namespace controllers]

## What
An **Owner** is the address that holds a CTAG after winning it through the ETS auction system or acquiring it through secondary markets. Owners have full control over their CTAGs and receive revenue from tagging fees.

## Why
Owners enable ETS to:
- Create a sustainable market for tag namespaces
- Generate ongoing revenue from tag usage
- Incentivize long-term protocol engagement
- Maintain active tag stewardship
- Drive protocol value through tag utility

## How

Owners participate in the protocol through CTAG acquisition and management.

### 1. Acquisition Methods
- Win CTAG through [ETS auction system](/docs/concepts/auction)
- Purchase from secondary markets
- Receive through direct transfer
- Hold until term expiration

### 2. Revenue Streams

Owners earn revenue through tagging fees:
- 50% of all tagging fees for owned CTAGs
- Fees collected per tag usage in Tagging Records
- Fees held in ETS core accrual account
- Available for withdrawal via `drawDown()`
- Revenue continues until term expiration

<Callout type="info">
The `drawDown()` function allows owners to withdraw their accumulated fees from the ETS core contract. The contract tracks earnings using an accrual system that maintains a record of both earned (`accrued`) and withdrawn (`paid`) amounts.
</Callout>

### 3. Ownership Rights

```solidity
struct Tag {
    address relayer;      // Original relayer address
    address creator;      // Original creator address
    string display;       // Tag string representation
    bool premium;         // Premium flag (deprecated)
    bool reserved;        // Reserved flag (deprecated)
}
```

### 4. Revenue Distribution

| Revenue Source | Owner Share | When Received |
|---------------|-------------|---------------|
| Tagging Fees  | 50%         | Per usage     |
| Resale        | 100%        | Upon sale     |

### 5. Term Management

Ownership terms are managed through the [ETSToken contract](https://github.com/ethereum-tag-service/ets/blob/main/packages/contracts/contracts/ETSToken.sol), creating a renewable ownership model that ensures active stewardship of CTAGs.

- Terms defined by `ownershipTermLength` protocol parameter
- Any address can renew a tag via `renewTag()`
- Term clock starts at transfer or last renewal timestamp
- Expired tags can be recycled by any address via `recycleTag()`
- Recycling transfers tag back to platform address
- Platform-held tags have no active term clock
- Term expiry checked via `tagOwnershipTermExpired()`
- Recycled tags become available for new auctions

<Callout type="info">
The term system uses block timestamps to track ownership periods. When tags are held by the platform (pre-auction or post-recycle), the term clock is reset to zero until transferred to a new owner.
