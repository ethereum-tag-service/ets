# Relayer <Icon src="/icons/relayer.svg" size={36} alt="Relayer Icon" /> [Bridging Your Application and ETS Core]

## What
A **Relayer** is the interface between applications and the ETS protocol, enabling developers to create, manage, and interact with tagging records on behalf of their users. It serves as the bridge connecting decentralized tagging infrastructure with real-world use cases.

  alt="Tagging Record Creation"
/>
## Why
Relayers enable ETS to:
- Provide a uniform, simple tagging interface for applications
- Ensure protocol-compliant tag and tagging record creation
- Ensure the application facilitating the tagging process is credited for its role
- Extend ETS functionality without modifying ETS core

## How
Relayers are deployed as upgradeable beacon proxies through the ETS governed [ETSRelayerFactory.sol](https://github.com/ethereum-tag-service/ets/blob/main/packages/contracts/contracts/ETSRelayerFactory.sol), pointing to [ETSRelayerV1.sol](https://github.com/ethereum-tag-service/ets/blob/main/packages/contracts/contracts/relayers/ETSRelayerV1.sol). This pattern ensures all Relayers can be upgraded **simultaneously** while maintaining their unique state and configuration.


### 1. Creating a Relayer
- Deployer must own at least one CTAG token
- Relayer name must be unique and 2-32 characters
- Only one Relayer allowed per owner address
- Deployer becomes Relayer admin and owner

<Callout type="info">We have provided a simple interface for deploying a Relayer on the [Relayers page](https://arbitrumsepolia.app.ets.xyz/explore/relayers) of the ETS Explorer for each chain.</Callout>

### 2. Core Functions
#### 2.1. CTAG & Tagging Record Management
- `getOrCreateTagIds()` - Create new or fetch existing CTAGs
- `applyTags()` - Create or append to tagging records
- `replaceTags()` - Overwrite tags in existing records
- `removeTags()` - Remove tags from records

#### 2.2. Raw Input Structure
```solidity
struct TaggingRecordRawInput {
    string targetURI;     // URI to be tagged
    string[] tagStrings;  // Array of tag strings
    string recordType;    // Type of tagging record
}
```
This raw input structure allows applications to interact with ETS core using simple strings rather than pre-computed IDs. See [IETS.TaggingRecordRawInput](/docs/contracts/reference/IETS#taggingrecordrawinput) and [SDK Core createTaggingRecord()](/docs/sdk-core/getting-started#simple-create-tagging-record).


### 3. Tagging Fees
ETS charges a protocol-defined fee for each CTAG used in tagging operations. These fees incentivize tag creation, maintain protocol economics, and reward participants in the ETS ecosystem.


<Callout type="info">Tagging fees are one part of the ETS tokenomics model. Learn more about [ETS Tokenomics](/docs/tokenomics).</Callout>


#### 3.1 Fee Handling
The Relayer provides a helper function `computeTaggingFee()` that allows applications to calculate **exact fees** before transactions, preventing failures. This is especially important when handling multiple tags or complex operations like APPEND and REPLACE actions.

The fee calculation considers:
- Number of new tags being added
- Type of action being performed (new record, append, replace)
- Current protocol-defined fee rate

This design ensures transparent, predictable fee handling while maintaining protocol economics. The Relayer's role in fee management is crucial for both proper protocol operation and good UX in applications using ETS.

```solidity
// Direct contract interaction
function computeTaggingFee(
    IETS.TaggingRecordRawInput calldata _rawInput,
    IETS.TaggingAction _action
) external view returns (uint256 fee, uint256 tagCount);
```

```typescript
// Using ETS SDK
const [fee, tagCount] = await relayer.computeTaggingFee(
    {
        targetURI: "https://example.com",
        tagStrings: ["#Example", "#Test"],
        recordType: "bookmark"
    },
    TaggingAction.APPEND
);

// Apply tags with computed fee
await relayer.applyTags([rawInput], { value: fee });

```

<Callout type="info">While this example shows explicit fee calculation for illustration, the ETS SDK's `createTaggingRecord()` function performs the fee calculation and tagging action in one function.</Callout>

## Future Extensions
The Relayer's upgradeable design makes it our primary focus for expanding ETS functionality. As detailed in our [roadmap](/docs/roadmap), planned extensions include:

- Dynamic fee structures based on market conditions
- Relayer-sponsored tagging fees for improved UX
- Pluggable access controls for custom restrictions
- Cross-chain tagging capabilities

These features will be implemented through Relayer upgrades, allowing applications to access new functionality without changes to ETS core contracts.
