# CTAG Auction <Icon src="/icons/auction.svg" size={36} alt="Auction Icon" /> [Fair and limited distribution of tag namespaces]

## What
The **ETS Auction** is a continuous English-style auction mechanism for distributing CTAGs. A fixed number of CTAGs is always up for auction, and when each auction ends, a new one automatically begins. Each auction runs for a fixed duration but may be extended in the final moments by new bids.

## Why
The auction system enables ETS to:
- Distribute CTAGs fairly to the community
- Control the rate of CTAG distribution through max number of concurrent auctions
- Establish market for CTAGs
- Generate revenue for protocol participants
- Prevent namespace squatting
- Create an engaging community dynamic

## How

Auctions are managed through the [ETSAuctionHouse.sol contract](https://github.com/ethereum-tag-service/ets/blob/main/packages/contracts/contracts/ETSAuctionHouse.sol). The design of the auction is inspired by the [Nouns DAO](https://nouns.wtf/) auction.

### Default Auction Settings

| Parameter | Variable | Value | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------|-------------|
| Max Concurrent Auctions | `maxAuctions` | 3 | Number of simultaneous auctions |
| Duration | `duration` | 24 hours | Length of each auction |
| Time Buffer | `timeBuffer` | 15 minutes | Extension period for late bids |
| Min Bid Increment | `minBidIncrementPercentage` | 5% | Minimum increase over previous bid |
| Reserve Price | `reservePrice` | 0.1 ETH | Minimum first bid amount |

<Callout type="info">Settings are subject to change during testnet phase, and will be governed by community vote after launch.</Callout>

### Auction Structure

```solidity
struct Auction {
    uint256 auctionId;        // Incremented auction number
    uint256 tokenId;          // CTAG being auctioned
    uint256 amount;           // Current highest bid
    uint256 startTime;        // Auction start time
    uint256 endTime;          // Scheduled end time
    uint256 reservePrice;     // Minimum first bid
    address payable bidder;   // Current highest bidder
    address payable auctioneer; // Defaults to ETS
    bool settled;             // Whether auction is settled
}
```

### Bidding
- Auction begins with first bid
- First bid must meet reserve price
- Subsequent bids must increase by minimum percentage
- Late bids extend auction by time buffer
- Bids must be in native currency (ETH)

> **Note**
> The auction extension mechanism ("time buffer") prevents last-second sniping by adding time when late bids are placed.

### Settling an Auction
- Auction must be ended to settle
- Any address can settle auction
- Winning bidder receives CTAG
- Proceeds distributed to:
  - Platform treasury
  - Tag creator
  - Originating relayer

### Auction Oracle

  alt="Tagging Record Creation"

The [ETS Auction Oracle](/docs/concepts/oracle) is an off-chain process that monitors the ETS Auction House and selects the next CTAG to be released for auction. The Oracle is responsible for:

- Detecting `RequestCreateAuction` event, which is emitted when an auction is settled
- Selecting CTAG with the highest use count (eg. used in most Tagging Records)
- If CTAGS have the same use count, the oldest CTAG is selected
- "Releasing" next CTAG for auction via on-chain transaction

### Revenue Distribution Model

When an auction is settled, the proceeds are automatically distributed between three key participants:

| Participant | Variable | Default&nbsp;% | Description |
|------------|----------|-----------|-------------|
| Tag Creator | `creatorPercentage` | 40 | Rewarded to the original creator of the CTAG |
| Relayer | `relayerPercentage` | 30 | Rewarded to the relayer that supported the creation of the CTAG |
| Platform Treasury | `platformPercentage` | 30 | Allocated to ETS protocol treasury |

The distribution works as follows:

1. The total auction amount is split according to the percentage allocations
2. Each participant's share is tracked in an `accrued` balance
3. Participants can withdraw their accrued balance at any time using the `drawDown()` function
4. The system maintains a record of lifetime earnings through the `paid` mapping

This model incentivizes:
- Tag creators to submit high-quality tags that get used frequently
- Relayers to support tag and tagging record creation
- Sustainable protocol revenue for ongoing development

The percentage splits are governed by the community and can be adjusted through the admin functions `setProceedPercentages()`.
