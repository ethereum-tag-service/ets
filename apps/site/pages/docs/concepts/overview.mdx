# ETS Key Concepts [The Search for a Universal Tagging System]

The Ethereum Tag Service (ETS) is a decentralized protocol that reimagines tagging by combining the power of blockchain, ERC-721 NFTs, and open data standards. It captures the "**who**, **what**, **where**, **when**, and **why**" of tagging actions in a verifiable and interoperable way, enabling a new paradigm for digital content organization and monetization.

At the heart of ETS are its key objects—**Tags (CTAGs)**, **Targets**, and **Tagging Records**—that form the building blocks of the protocol. These interact with a set of actors, including **Relayers**, **Taggers**, **Creators**, and **Owners**, who participate in creating, propagating, and deriving value from tags and tagging. Together, these components power a decentralized ecosystem where attribution, ownership, and incentives align to foster collaboration and innovation.

By exploring the pages in this section, you'll gain a deeper understanding of how ETS works, from tags as tokenized objects to the mechanics of tagging to the economic incentives that drive the system.
