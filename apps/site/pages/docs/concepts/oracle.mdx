# ETS Oracle <Icon src="/icons/oracle.svg" size={36} alt="Oracle Icon" /> [Bridging on-chain and off-chain processes]

## What
The **ETS Oracle** facilitates off-chain processes that support the Ethereum Tag Service.

## Why
The Oracle enables ETS to:
- Automate CTAG selection and release for auction
- Collect and store metadata about tagged content
- Enhance protocol functionality through off-chain computation
- Bridge between blockchain events and external data

## How
The Oracle leverages [OpenZeppelin Defender](https://www.openzeppelin.com/defender) for event monitoring and secure transaction execution.

<Callout type="info">While currently using OpenZeppelin Defender, ETS plans to progressively adopt more decentralized infrastructure solutions.</Callout>

### Auction Oracle

The Auction Oracle is responsible for:

1. Monitoring blockchain for CTAG auction settlement events
2. Selecting next CTAG to release based on usage metrics pulled from the [ETS API](/docs/api/intro)
4. Releasing selected CTAG through on-chain transaction. See [ETSAuctionHouse.fulfillRequestCreateAuction](/docs/contracts/reference/ETSAuctionHouse#fulfillrequestcreateauction-0x279a0147).

### Future Capabilities
As outlined in our [roadmap](/docs/roadmap), the Oracle will expand to:
- Enrich Target records with metadata
- Update Token information from external sources
- Support dynamic fee calculations
- Enable cross-chain functionality
