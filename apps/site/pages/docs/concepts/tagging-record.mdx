# Tagging Record <Icon src="/icons/tagging-record.svg" size={36} alt="Tagging Record Icon" />

## What
A **Tagging Record** is the fundamental data structure of ETS that captures the relationship between tags (CTAGs), targets (URIs), and participants (Relayers and Taggers). Each record has a unique ID computed from its composite elements.


## Why
Tagging Records enable ETS to:
- Track who applied which tags to what content
- Maintain provenance of tagging actions
- Support multiple tagging contexts through record types
- Enable fee distribution to CTAG owners and relayers
- Create composable on-chain tagging history

## How

Tagging Records are created and managed through the [ETS core contract](https://github.com/ethereum-tag-service/ets/blob/main/packages/contracts/contracts/ETS.sol) through authorized ETS Relayer contracts. These Relayers interact with the ETS core contract which manages record creation, modification, and fee distribution to ensure all tagging actions follow protocol rules.

### 1. Data Structure
Tagging Records are stored on-chain as structs containing the essential elements of who tagged what, where and why:

```solidity
struct TaggingRecord {
    uint256[] tagIds;     // Ids of CTAG token(s)
    uint256 targetId;     // Id of target being tagged
    string recordType;    // Arbitrary identifier for type of record
    address relayer;      // Address of Relayer contract
    address tagger;       // Address that initiated tagging
}
```


### 2. Record ID Generation
Each Tagging Record has a unique ID computed from its composite elements:

```solidity
taggingRecordId = uint256(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(
    targetId,
    recordType,
    relayer,
    tagger
)));
```

This ensures that every tagging event is uniquely identifiable and attributable.

### 2. Creating Records
- Use `createTaggingRecord()` for new records with validated tags and targets
- Use `applyTagsWithRawInput()` with strings for convenient creation
- Use `applyTagsWithCompositeKey()` with existing tag/target IDs
- Each creation generates a unique record ID and emits event

### 3. Modifying Records
The following actions can be performed on existing tagging records by the original tagger via any ETS Relayer:
- **APPEND**: Add additional tags to existing record
- **REPLACE**: Overwrite existing tags with new set
- **REMOVE**: Remove specific tags from record

<Callout type="info">A tagging record can't be deleted, but all tags can be removed. Each modification emits a `TaggingRecordUpdated` event and any new tags added will incur standard tagging fees.</Callout>

### 4. Tagging Fees
- ETS charges a protocol-governed fee for each CTAG used in a tagging record
- This fee is also collected when new tags are added to a record via the APPEND action
- No fee is incurred for removing CTAGs from a record

### 5. Fee Distribution
When these fees are collected:
- Platform receives base percentage
- CTAG's originating Relayer receives commission
- Tag owners receive remaining share
