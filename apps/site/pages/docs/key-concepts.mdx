# Key Concepts [Components & Actors of the ETS Protocol.]

## Tag (CTAG) ![Tag Icon](/icons/tag.svg)

- **What it is:** A unique ERC-721 NFT representing a tag. Tags are case-insensitive, e.g., `#Punks`, `#punks`, and `#PUNKS` resolve to the same CTAG.
- **Why it matters:** CTAGs ensure ownership and attribution, capturing the creator and relayer of each tag.
- **Tokenomics:** Tags can be minted automatically during tagging or independently. Auctioned tags distribute proceeds among the relayer, creator, and the protocol.

## Target ![Target Icon](/icons/target.svg)

- **What it is:** A data structure pointing to a URI, enabling tagging of digital content such as web pages or blockchain assets.
- **Why it matters:** Targets standardize how tagged content is referenced and ensure compatibility across applications.

## Tagging Record ![Tagging Record Icon](/icons/tagging-record.svg)

- **What it is:** A blockchain-based record linking CTAGs to Targets. Includes details like who tagged the content, the platform (Relayer), and the context (Record Type).
- **Why it matters:** Provides a verifiable history of tagging actions, enabling decentralized attribution and value capture.
- **Tokenomics:** ETS core charges micro-fees for tagging, with proceeds distributed to stakeholders.

## Relayer ![Relayer Icon](/icons/relayer.svg)

- **What it is:** Third-party applications or platforms that integrate with ETS to create tagging records.
- **Why it matters:** Relayers ensure tagging records are linked to their originating platforms, adding provenance.
- **Tokenomics:** Relayers share in the revenue generated from tag fees and auctions.

## Tagger ![Tagger Icon](/icons/users.svg)

- **What it is:** The user or machine initiating a tagging action via a relayer.
- **Why it matters:** Taggers drive the protocol by adding value through content association.

## Creator ![Creator Icon](/icons/users.svg)

- **What it is:** The entity minting a CTAG. Creators can be users or relayers.
- **Why it matters:** Creators gain attribution and a share of future revenue tied to their tags.

## Auctioneer ![Auction Icon](/icons/auction.svg)

- **What it is:** The entity managing CTAG auctions, starting with ETS itself.
- **Why it matters:** Auctions incentivize early adopters and fairly distribute valuable tags.

## Owner ![Owner Icon](/icons/users.svg)

- **What it is:** The purchaser of a CTAG via auctions or secondary markets.
- **Why it matters:** Owners acquire control and potential revenue from tags.
