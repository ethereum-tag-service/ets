# The ETS Subgraph

ETS uses subgraphs for indexing and organizing data from the ETS smart contracts. These subgraphs are hosted on The Graph hosted service and can be used to query ETS data.

## Endpoints

ETS has dedicated subgraphs for different networks. Each subgraph has a dedicated endpoint for querying data.
