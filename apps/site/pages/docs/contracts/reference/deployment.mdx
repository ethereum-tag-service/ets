# ETS Contract Deployment & Upgrade Guide

## Overview

The Ethereum Tag Service (ETS) uses a robust deployment and upgrade system built on hardhat-deploy and OpenZeppelin's UUPS proxy pattern. This system manages deployments, tracks implementation versions, and handles upgrades across multiple networks while maintaining a complete history of all contract changes.

## Deploying Contracts

First-time deployment of ETS contracts to a new blockchain:

```bash
hardhat deployETS --network <network-name>
```

This deploys the complete ETS contract suite in the correct order:

1. ETSAccessControls
2. ETSToken
3. ETSAuctionHouse
4. ETSTarget
5. ETSEnrichTarget
6. ETS
7. ETSRelayerBeacon
8. ETSRelayer

The deployment information is automatically saved to `src/upgradeConfig/<network-name>.json`.

## Upgrading Contracts

Contracts can be upgraded individually or all at once.

### Upgrade All Contracts

```bash
hardhat deployETS --network <network-name> --tags upgradeAll
```

<Callout type="tip">The `upgradeAll` tag is safe to run at any time - it automatically skips contracts that haven't changed, only upgrading implementations with new versions.</Callout>

### Upgrade Individual Contracts

```bash
hardhat deployETS --network <network-name> --tags upgradeETSAccessControls
hardhat deployETS --network <network-name> --tags upgradeETSToken
hardhat deployETS --network <network-name> --tags upgradeETS
```

Each upgrade:

- Verifies implementation changes
- Updates the proxy to point to new implementation
- Records upgrade history in network configuration
- Maintains version tracking

### Deployment Stack Structure

│   ├── 10_ETSAccessControls.js
│   ├── 20_ETSToken.js
│   ├── 25_ETSAuctionHouse.js
│   ├── 30_ETSTarget.js
│   └── 40_ETSEnrichTarget.js
│
├── upgrade/                  # Contract upgrade scripts
│   ├── ETSAccessControls.js

└── utils/                   # Shared utilities
    ├── config.js           # Configuration management
    ├── setup.js           # Deployment environment setup
    ├── upgrade.js         # Centralized upgrade logic
    └── verify.js          # Contract verification
```

The deployment stack is organized into three main directories:

1. **core/** - Contains numbered deployment scripts that handle first-time contract deployments. The numbering ensures correct deployment order and dependencies.

2. **upgrade/** - Houses individual contract upgrade scripts. Each script uses the shared upgrade utility while maintaining contract-specific upgrade logic.

3. **utils/** - Provides shared utilities used across both deployments and upgrades:
   - `config.js`: Manages network configurations and upgrade history
   - `setup.js`: Handles deployment environment initialization
   - `upgrade.js`: Centralizes upgrade logic and version management
   - `verify.js`: Handles contract verification on block explorers

### Key Components

1. **Deployment Scripts** (`deploy/*.js`)
   - Numbered deployment sequence (10_, 20_, etc.)
   - Individual upgrade scripts (110_, 120_, etc.)
   - Uses tags for selective deployment/upgrade

2. **Upgrade Utility** (`deploy/utils/upgrade.js`)
   - Centralized upgrade logic
   - Handles version checking
   - Manages implementation address tracking
   - Controls contract verification

3. **Configuration Management** (`deploy/utils/config.js`)
   - Tracks deployments and upgrades
   - Maintains implementation history
   - Network-specific configuration files

4. **Contract Structure**
   - UUPS upgradeable pattern
   - Version tracking in contracts
   - Access control hierarchy

### Deployment Flow

1. Initial deployment creates proxy and implementation contracts
2. Proxy addresses remain constant
3. Upgrades deploy new implementations
4. Configuration tracks all changes

### Configuration Format

```json
{
  "contracts": {
    "ContractName": {
      "address": "proxyAddress",
      "implementation": "currentImplementationAddress",
      "deploymentBlock": "initialDeploymentBlock",
      "upgradeHistory": [
        {
          "block": "blockNumber",
          "implementation": "implementationAddress"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Version Control

- Each upgradeable contract includes a VERSION constant
- Version changes trigger implementation updates
- Upgrade history maintains complete audit trail

### Network Support

- Supports local development (hardhat, localhost)
- Test networks (baseSepolia)
- Production networks
- Network-specific configuration files

This deployment stack ensures consistent, trackable contract deployments and upgrades while maintaining a complete history of all contract changes across any supported network.
