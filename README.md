## What is ETS?

An experimental content tagging protocol for the decentralized internet.

ETS is a simple, decentralized protocol built for developers to tokenize hashtag strings as non-fungible tokens (NFTs), link them with online media and surface this data for use in networks, platforms and applications.

In addition, our vision is to create a full market economy around the value in tags and the tag graph.

## Getting Started

If you want to jump right in, head over to [JavaScript client quickstart](./docs/js-client-quickstart.md) or [Contract-to-contract quickstart](./docs/contract-to-contract-quickstart.md).

To learn a bit more before diving in, see [key concepts](./docs/key-concepts.md) and the [system architecture diagram](./docs/system-architecture.md/).

## Contributing

ETS is an alpha/testnet service being "developed in the open" as open source software (OSS). As such, public participation is both welcome and necessary for the project to thrive.

This monorepo contains the entire code base for Ethereum Tag Service including smart contracts, subgraph and various front-end applications. It uses [Turborepo](https://turborepo.org/) and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) as a package manager for the monorepo.

For code releases we use [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).

For developers (or anyone for that matter), with questions & feedback please use our our Discord (linked below) or Github [discussion forum](https://github.com/ethereum-tag-service/ets/discussions). For bug reports or issues, please [open an issue](https://github.com/ethereum-tag-service/ets/issues).
