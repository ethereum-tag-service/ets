# Ethers.js quickstart

We have written a handful of Hardhat tasks to make the process of learning about how to interact with ETS backend from a Javascript library a bit easier. This guide will cover two parts, a quick guide to quickly interacting directly with ETS on Polygon Mumbai using the Hardhat Tasks we have provided in the code suite. The second part will go into more detail on the Tasks to provide some context as to what is happening behind the scenes.
