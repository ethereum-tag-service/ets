# Ethers.js quickstart

TODO.

There are two ways to read and write to the ETS backend: via a JavaScript library such as [Ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/), [Web3.js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.8.0/) or [Wagmi](https://wagmi.sh/), which allow developers to interact with smart contracts running on an EVM compatible blockchain. The other is making contract-to-contract calls where a third-party owned contract may read or write to ETS while performing it's own tasks.

This guide covers the former.
