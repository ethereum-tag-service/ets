# Overview

Ethereum Tag Service (ETS) is an experimental EVM based content tagging service, aimed at Web3 developers, running in alpha/testnet phase on the Polygon Blockchain.

In ETS, tags, content tagging & tagging data are fully composable units & services. This treatment preserves data integrity, provenance & attribution across the projects and users that consume the service. The result is (hopefully) a novel way to connect people, places and things across Web3.
