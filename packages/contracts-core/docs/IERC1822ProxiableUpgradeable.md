**IERC1822ProxiableUpgradeable**

ERC1822: Universal Upgradeable Proxy Standard (UUPS) documents a method for upgradeability through a simplified
 proxy whose upgrades are fully controlled by the current implementation.

## Functions

- [proxiableUUID](#proxiableuuid)

### proxiableUUID

Returns the storage slot that the proxiable contract assumes is being used to store the implementation
 address.
 IMPORTANT: A proxy pointing at a proxiable contract should not be considered proxiable itself, because this risks
 bricking a proxy that upgrades to it, by delegating to itself until out of gas. Thus it is critical that this
 function revert if invoked through a proxy.

```solidity
function proxiableUUID() external view
returns(bytes32)
```

| Name        | Type           | Description  |
